Nominal power for each of the 4x4 heating elements for each experiment.
For example, in the "one" experiment the heater at the top left corner is powered
at 3W, while all the other heaters are set to 0.2W (to simulate leakage power).
Also, for each experiment, the total power applied to the thermal test chip is
reported.

NOTE for version 2 of this dataset.
Some issues were found in the first version of the dataset, namely:
- a software issue in one device driver caused the temperature of two
  experiments to be "rotated", T(1) was actually T(16), T(2) was T(1), ...
  This issue has been fixed.
- a hardware modification altered the calibration parameters, causing
  temperatures to be off by up to 1.5Â°C. The device has been recalibrated and
  the appropriate calibration was applied post-facto to the dataset.
- some experiments exhibited bad thermal contact between the some heating
  elements of the chip and heatsink, those experiments have been redone.
These issues only affect the heatsink_with_fan dataset.
